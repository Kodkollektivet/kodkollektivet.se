"\n"
"          Kodkollektivet consists of a group of students with a great "
"interest\n"
"          in programming, computer networking and tons of other IT and "
"business\n"
"          related topics. We started in the summer of 2015 with tons of "
"ideas\n"
"          that we since then have been trying out, refined and most "
"importantly\n"
"          learned a great deal from in terms of cooperation, planning and\n"
"          focus.\n"
"\n"
"          With all of this Kodkollektivet is now taking the shape of a "
"student\n"
"          organization at Linnaeus University. Focus has shifted slightly "
"from\n"
"          project development and code meetups to more of a social platform\n"
"          where students and local businesses can find, meet and get to "
"know\n"
"          each other through events and activities such as theme-nights,\n"
"          hackathons, workshops, study visits, guest lectures and more.\n"
"\n"
"          As a result of this students at Linnaeus University are provided "
"with\n"
"          a place to find other students with a shared or similar interest,\n"
"          while at the same time giving companies in the Vaxjo area the\n"
"          opportunity to get a head start with potential employees.\n"
