          {% blocktrans %}
          Kodkollektivet consists of a group of students with a great interest
          in programming, computer networking and tons of other IT and business
          related topics. We started in the summer of 2015 with tons of ideas
          that we since then have been trying out, refined and most importantly
          learned a great deal from in terms of cooperation, planning and
          focus.

          With all of this Kodkollektivet is now taking the shape of a student
          organization at Linnaeus University. Focus has shifted slightly from
          project development and code meetups to more of a social platform
          where students and local businesses can find, meet and get to know
          each other through events and activities such as theme-nights,
          hackathons, workshops, study visits, guest lectures and more.

          As a result of this students at Linnaeus University are provided with
          a place to find other students with a shared or similar interest,
          while at the same time giving companies in the Vaxjo area the
          opportunity to get a head start with potential employees.

        <h2 align="center">{% trans "Student, do you have what it takes" %}?</h2>
        <p>
          {% blocktrans %}
          Absolutely! No previous experience or particular skills are required
          to take part of Kodkollektivet. We welcome anyone who wants to learn,
          share, improve their resume or just want to make more friends with
          similar interests!

          Kodkollektivet puts no requirements on you as a student, but is rather
          a provider of opportunities. You are free to decide for yourself how
          much you would like to participate and how much time you want to put
          into the activities and events we host.

          The university students of today are the very people who will be
          urging new thoughts and ideas in tomorrows businesses. Through
          Kodkollektivet is the possibility to meet these students in a social,
          comfortable environment without prestige. Kodkollektivet is always
          open to any type of suggestions from you as a company, in regards of
          ideas for events and activities.
